Programming Language Ranking API
Welcome to the Programming Language Ranking API project! This Java-based API aims to provide a simple and efficient way to rank various programming languages based on popularity, performance, and community support. Our goal is to make it easy for developers, educators, and businesses to make informed decisions when choosing the best programming languages for their projects.

Features
Retrieve a list of popular programming languages ranked by different criteria
Filter and sort languages based on specific attributes such as popularity, performance, or community support
Access detailed information on each language, including its history, primary uses, and resources for learning
Extensible architecture allowing for the addition of new ranking factors and data sources
Getting Started
To get started with the Programming Language Ranking API, simply clone this repository, and follow the instructions in the README.md file to set up your development environment and run the API locally.

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or suggesting new features. We appreciate your support in making this API better for everyone!
